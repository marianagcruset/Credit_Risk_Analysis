# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

We used data from people based on gender, age, and education to analyze their ability to pay back loans. We attempt to use Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn libraries to create different supervised machine learning techniques to achieve this. 

## Tools used

Python 3.7

## Results

Based on the analysis we were able to determine as follow:

1.	We discovered that is easier for females to pay back their loans.
2.	Older people are usually more stable financially speaking; therefore, they tend to comply with their obligations on time.
3.	The younger the person, the riskier it is to provide them a big loan.
4.	We determine the people that we think will be able to repay their debt.

## Summary

I believe that the worst scenario a model could give us within this context, is classifying a borrower who is actuality high-risk, as low-risk one. This would indicate to the lender that the individual is not in danger of defaulting on their loan, probably causing them to lend out a larger amount than they should, having said that, and considering that that could happen I would not recommend any of these models for predicting loan applications. I think it is important to have a high precision rate for high-risk applications to identify those at risk to a company or a bank.
